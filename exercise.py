# Great! Practicing is an excellent way to solidify your understanding of NumPy. Below are some practice exercises and tasks that you can work on to enhance your skills with NumPy:

# ### Exercise 1: Create NumPy Arrays

# 1. Create a 1D array with values ranging from 0 to 9.
# 2. Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8.
# 3. Create a 5x5 identity matrix.

# ### Exercise 2: Array Operations

# 1. Add two 2D arrays element-wise.
# 2. Multiply two 2D arrays element-wise.
# 3. Compute the dot product of two 2D arrays.

# ### Exercise 3: Array Slicing and Indexing

# 1. Extract all the odd numbers from an array.
# 2. Reverse the rows of a 2D array.
# 3. Extract the diagonal elements of a 3x3 matrix.

# ### Exercise 4: Array Manipulation

# 1. Reshape a 1D array into a 3x3 matrix.
# 2. Flatten a 2D array into a 1D array.
# 3. Stack two 1D arrays vertically and horizontally.

# ### Exercise 5: Mathematical Functions

# 1. Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of an array.
# 2. Find the minimum and maximum values in an array.
# 3. Normalize a given array (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation).

# ### Exercise 6: Advanced Operations

# 1. Find the unique elements in an array.
# 2. Sort an array in ascending and descending order.
# 3. Replace all negative values in an array with 0.

# ### Exercise 7: Random Number Generation

# 1. Generate a 1D array with 10 random integers between 1 and 100.
# 2. Create a 3x3 matrix with random values sampled from a standard normal distribution.
# 3. Shuffle the elements of a 1D array.

# ### Exercise 8: File Operations

# 1. Save an array to a text file.
# 2. Load an array from a text file.

# ### Exercise 9: Linear Algebra

# 1. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
# 2. Solve a system of linear equations.
# 3. Compute the matrix inverse.

# ### Exercise 10: Boolean Indexing

# 1. Find all the elements greater than a certain value in an array.
# 2. Count the number of elements less than a certain value in an array.
# 3. Extract elements from an array based on a condition.

# You can start with these exercises and gradually move on to more complex tasks as you become more comfortable with NumPy. Remember to consult the NumPy documentation and use online resources to help you if you get stuck or need more information on specific functions and methods. Happy coding!
